This repository contains the analysis code associated with the **###** project, led by **###**. This manuscript has been submitted for publication under the title **"#####"**.

This manuscript has been submitted as a preprint via BioRxiv [here](biorxiv/link). A link to the final version will be provided upon publication.

## Prerequisites

This analysis assumes a standard installation of Python 3 (=> **version**). For specific package requirements, see the environment.yml file, or  create a new conda environment containing all packages by running ```conda create -f environment.yml```. In addition to the analysis contained here, some simple statistical tests were performed using [GraphPad Prism v **8.0**](https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/).

## Raw data

For convenience, example datasets are provided here under the ```data``` folder. These data may be used to explore the workflows presented here as described below.

In addition, the complete set of raw data have been uploaded as an open-access [Zenodo dataset](https://doi.org/###/zenodo.###). These datasets can be collected automatically using the ```raw_data.py``` script in each of the respective analysis folders.

## Workflow

Initial preprocessing of the raw data was performed using this [Really Cool Method][1] <sup>[1]</sup>. Example preprocessed data (hereon termed raw data) are provided here within the ```data``` folder to test the included analysis scripts.

Individual analyses are presented within the ```src``` folder. Where processing order is important for individual analyses, scripts have been numbered and should be run in order before unnumbered counterparts.
